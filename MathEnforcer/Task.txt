Your task is to test an object named mathEnforcer, which should have the following functionality:

· addFive(num) - A function that accepts a single parameter:

o If the parameter is NOT a number, the function should return undefined.

o If the parameter is a number, add 5 to it, and return the result.

· subtractTen(num) - A function that accepts a single parameter:

o If the parameter is NOT a number, the function should return undefined.

o If the parameter is a number, subtract 10 from it, and return the result.

· sum(num1, num2) - A function that accepts two parameters:

o If any of the 2 parameters is NOT a number, the function should return undefined.

o If both parameters are numbers, the function should return their sum.

JS Code

You are provided with an implementation of the mathEnforcer object.

The methods should function correctly for positive, negative, and floating-point numbers. In the case of floating-point numbers, the result should be considered correct if it is within 0.01 of the correct value

Your tests will be supplied with a variable named "mathEnforcer" which contains the mentioned above logic. All test cases you write should reference this variable.
