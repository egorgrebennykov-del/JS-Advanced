Create a functionality that gets a text from textarea, formats the given text - you need to find out how many sentences there are in the text, simply split the whole text by '.' Also, every sentence must have at least 1 character.

Otherwise, when you have more than 3 sentences, create enough paragraphs to get all sentences from the textarea.

Just remember to restrict the sentences in each paragraph to 3.
